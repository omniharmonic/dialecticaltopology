When I've worked with trauma survivors, those who find the hidden benefits\u2014not denying the pain, but seeing the full picture\u2014achieve genuine liberation.

When I witness my wife being assaulted, my obligation to intervene doesn't arise from incomplete perception. It arises from a real event causing real harm to a real person.

Marcus operates primarily as a moral agent\u2014his framework optimizes for responding DURING harm. Both are valid in their domains; problems arise when either is universalized.\n\n**2. Temporal Framing**\n- BEFORE harm: Prevention through understanding (Demartini) AND moral education about wrong (Marcus)\n- DURING harm: Intervention, action, stopping harm (Marcus's emphasis)\n- AFTER harm: Meaning-making, integration, avoiding victimhood (Demartini's emphasis)\n\n**3. Epistemological Difference**\nDemartini grounds knowledge in therapeutic outcomes and nondual philosophy. Marcus grounds knowledge in somatic experience and moral intuition. Both epistemologies have value; neither is complete alone.\n\n**4. The Irreducible Disagreement**\nWhether evil has ontological status (is real) or merely epistemological status (is a label we apply) may not be resolvable. However, both can agree: unnecessary suffering should be reduced, understanding aids prevention, victims deserve protection, and survivors can find meaning.\n\n**The conversation's value was not in resolving the disagreement but in clarifying its structure.** Future discourse can build on this map.",
