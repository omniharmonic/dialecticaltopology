      "text": "I came into this podcast with Dr John Demartini expecting to have a conversation about how our thoughts can impact our reality and how we can utilize our belief field to actually draw towards us those things that we're more resonant with. But what happened very quickly was something much different. We highlighted a bright point of distinction in our worldviews, and this turned into a very intense debate. And I think debate is healthy. I think when people have two different opinions and they stand by those opinions and still allow themselves to have the discussion, something greater emerges. Now at some point I didn't think that we could even make it through. It felt like the chasm was so wide that even having the conversation itself wasn't going to be fruitful or actually beneficial for the people listening. But as time went on, I'm more grateful for this conversation, because I think it highlights two different worldviews. Is there such a thing as good and evil, or is it all the one source without distinction? I believe it's a bit of both. And in this conversation, you'll see two clearly defined points of view, and you'll be able to assess where do I stand in these two different ideas, these two different paradigms of thought and belief, and what can I use in my own life to how I want to guide myself through this wild journey through life itself. So I hope you guys enjoy this intense and ultimately beautiful conversation with Dr John dimartini, if you had one piece of code that you could psychically transmit to every human on the planet. What would that code be?",

So if I perceive somebody that's a predator, they're there to make me realize that they're representing a part of me that I haven't owned and loved and appreciated, and they're giving me a chance now to go and do that. So whatever we perceive in them is just if we're resenting them, it's because it's reminding us of some part of ourselves that we haven't appreciated, that we're somehow feeling guilty or shame about. And they're bringing us that ability to go and discover that, find out how it's served, after all, and find out how they're serving us as our teacher, not our not our obstacle.

Be able to see the whole at the same time. The unity of opposites, the synthesis and synchronicity of complementary opposites, is what I described love to be. It's part of love too. There's the law of heuristic escalation shows that whatever we seek and we believe in the equal and opposite is always there to balance it in the universe and in the world to make sure we don't get proud about our perception perceptions and we get humbled by the other to make sure that we keep ourselves authentic.",

They let's say somebody does a particular act that they perceive to be terrible, that they have been indoctrinated by some moral hypocrisy, that that's a bad thing. And I go, Okay, go to that moment. Let's look at where it is, when it is, what it is, who it was from, and at that moment, how did it serve you? And they go, well, didn't and I go, but how did it? Because you're assuming, if you're seeing only one side, that that's a projection of your, your your putting a box on that, that action. So when they go and they look and they discovered there was it catalyzed a reflection. It catalyzed a humbleness. It catalyzed independency. It made them less disempowered. It gave them catalyst of some form. I always say, any area of your life, you're not empowered, and you'll be overpowered by somebody to help you become empowered in that area. And when they stop, and they find the other side that subsides as being something terrible, and it becomes now something fuel, some opportunity to grow from. So the challenges in life are necessary to make sure that we have precocious independence, and the over supportive nature that we try to addict ourselves to one side is what keeps us juvenile dependent. And so we get caught sometimes in our amygdala, seeking a one sided world instead of embracing the two sides that life always offers. And if they we see them separate, as Wilhelm want in 1897 described sequential contrast and simultaneous contrast. Sequential contrast is we see a positive, and then later we see the negative, like we're, in fact, with somebody, and later we discover their downsides, or we see somebody we think is terrible, and then later we discover, wow, my life changed at that moment. Why wait for the wisdom the ages with the aging process? Why not just ask the right questions and see that it's there now? See both sides simultaneously and become poised and present and purposeful. See things on the way. Yep.",

We make events positive or negative in parts of the world that we in the Middle East, older men and younger girls are married for centuries, for at least 1500 years. Uh, in America, that's you go to jail for it. So in their culture, it's a different culture. So if you have a international or global view, you don't react to either of those polls. You don't see one because of your localization as good and the other bad. You see it from a perspective that is now understanding these are pairs of opposites, and there's the unit of opposites in the world, and for every ideologue that promotes one, there's an ideologue that promotes the other to counterbalance it, to keep the body and the the, you might say, the Soul of the World, the animal Mundi, in equilibrium. So I don't, I don't like to negate something because of my lack of seeing the whole. I'd rather go and dig deeper and find it, but I don't label it with a it's bad or good. I just say it's an event. Now, how do we use it in consequentialism? Nobody knows the consequence of an action. We can assume it's positive or negative because of our training, but if we look over time, the central limit theorem shows that the bell curve distribution of positive and negative outcomes will eventually surface. So if we take a narrow, short term view, we'll see positive or negative. If we take a long term view, we will see that it's just inevitable growth process of learning. I mean, sometimes people in their 50s realize the things that they thought were terrible in their childhood. They now go, thank you. Why wait 3040, 50 years to do it? Why not look now and find it?",

      "text": "Well, if we study, I just wrote a textbook on morality of this last year again, and the evolution of morality is an evolution of the brain. The brain's amygdala has the amygdala, which is a subcortical nuclei, assigns valency to events that are stimuli that are invoked from the outside world, and we label it either prey or predator, good or bad, attraction, repulsion, impulse, instinct, and we label those things, and they're not but our first perceptions, and then we go through we we think, okay, that's a that's a terrific thing. A guy meets a girl, and he thinks, Oh, my God, that's That's amazing. And then over the next few weeks or months, he discovers what that she's got things he didn't see. He was blind by that infatuation initially, and so the amygdala fooled him, because it needs to accelerate its misperceptions and false positives in order to capture the prey, or it fools them into an escaping a predator. But then what happens is the person that you infatuate with, eventually you discover some of the downsides and find out. Now I know both sides of the person, and I start to love this person I was infatuated, confusing that with love. Now I'm discovering love for who, what it really is, and the same thing that same person can now because they didn't match the fantasy. You can then be angry at them, and now they're part of your nightmare. And then you eventually discover there's some benefits in the part that's a side you don't like about the person. Eventually realize that those two sides, where you're in complete awareness is and that there's, there's a beautiful bouquet of opportunities sitting in both sides the unity of opposites. So morality starts out with the amygdala, and eventually through the cingulate cortex. It goes up in the medial prefrontal cortex, where it sees things objectively and it sees it neutrally and doesn't see it. And so for in absolute morality, which is the most primitive form of morality, it eventually goes into what is called a relativism and a situational ethics, which is more objective. And that, what that does is allows us to stop and not just immediately react, but see things as they are, which has both sides, because we with our incomplete awareness label things, only to find out that that label was our incompleteness. And Michael montane traveled all over the world trying to find a universally morally ascended value system, only to discover that in time and space, none ever were ascended so life and death and all these things that we label good and bad throughout history have been there and have been labeled good or bad, depending on who you're taking sides with, a jihadist who is believing very strongly in eliminating anything that's not his belief is doing what he thinks is good in Afghanistan. Stand where somebody in a western world would think he's doing something evil, and Epictetus says that any human being will not do anything unless they believe there's more advantage and disadvantage in their value system at that time, and so they're going to do what they think is good, and somebody else may think it's bad, but that means that which is true to the jihadist, his belief is his belief, and the other person's got a different belief. I'm trying to take a perspective that, how do we find both sides in these things? Because if not, we take a side, and the more we take a side, the more we create an API side, the side, meaning I'm right and you're wrong. You need to stop this. This is dangerous. Eventually, the more we try to do that, the more we create, the very thing we're trying to eliminate. So we either anything we try to avoid, we create running into, and keep doing it again. So I'm more of a asking a question, what are the downsides to what they think is up to help them like a dialectic, instead of a debate a dialectic. What's the downside to the person who's a jihadist? So they can become aware and listen to the person that sees the downside and what is the upside to the person that sees that is evil, so they can both learn how to love and appreciate each other and communicate and have a way of communicating their differences together.",

I think what we have is that that's we've personified that and gives names to it and call it good or evil, or God or devil and things like that. But these are anthropomorphisms. The reality is that there's an event there. I'm not negating that the person is doing something that challenges you. He may be taking your wife's life or trying to, if you value your wife, you'll try to save her life. That's perfectly understandable, and that would be good in your perspective, if you valued him, and somebody was supporting him and he thought that she had done something that challenged him.

You're now going to go, Okay, I've, may have saved her life, but I've just killed somebody. So I'm now taking two I'm doing a situational moral system there. If I murdered a person out of self defense, that's considered good in some countries. In other places, you've now got out, you've just killed somebody. Over here, you just save somebody's life. You're a hero and a villain at the same moment. So you have to decide which one is your belief. If you have a belief that that one's good by saving her, and this one's bad by killing him, but saving it because it's defense, then that's the situational ethics that you put yourself in. I'm not going to make it good or bad. I don't know exactly what that's going to be in that setting. I know that hypotheticals. It's easy to come up with hypotheticals, but the probability of your wife having an attacker is less likely, if, unless she's somehow trying to live in anxiety and overprotection and putting herself in a position where that might happen.

But if it's a real case, what he did in that setting based on his perceptions at that moment and what his values were, he responded, that's all we can do. Some people will would watch that and avoid and run and hide. Others will go and attack. If they thought that they could achieve something that was meaningful in their value system, they'll possibly attack the attacker. Another person would hide and scream and hide and try to protect themselves. Which one is good? You tell me. So if you, if you feel you could actually like the they when they had the shooting in Bondi Beach, there's a guy that went and attacked the guy that was shooting well, he had some special forces training or something. He had some knowledge and things, and he didn't feel that that was overwhelming to try that, but most people Running, hiding under cars and doing whatever they could. So to say that one's good and the other one's bad, or whatever is I don't, I don't think that's that didn't make sense to me. What does make sense is that value system of that individual at that moment, with those perceptions are going to determine how they're going to react, and each of those reactions are going to be appropriate to them in that perception. I can't, I can't make that one wrong for for coward and running under the car. I can't make that just good because he went to do it, because he could have killed himself and been a foolish actor. We don't know and what those consequences are. All I know is that the person did. He went out of his way, and he thought he could tackle the guy, and he did, but he didn't get him to stop shooting. He kept shooting afterwards, but he still tried his best to stop him. So in his case, he thought that was the wisest another person's case, running under a car was his wisest thing. Because he may be thinking, or she may be thinking, I got three kids at home. If I go over there and I do that and I get killed, my kids are are going to be left without food and clothing and shelter, so they're going to have to sit down and make a situational ethics at that moment. Do I go in? I save my kids and have a higher value of my kids, and save my life for the sake of my family? My wife just died. I have nothing to lose. I'm going to go ahead and attack that guy I don't know until I go and look at all the different parameters the situation, to put that together, to put some sort of assessment on that. And I'm not going to put make them as good or bad. I'm just going to say that human beings are going to respond based on their values at that moment to that situation, based on what their experiences is.",

Family, there's doctor, three generations of doctors, so the pressure on the family had to be doctors in the process of doing that, and they all had to be males. So they had a daughter, and they didn't want a daughter. They wanted all males. The mother had this fantasy that I have to have males, and I don't want a daughter. So the daughter was rejected by the family, by the mother, particularly the daughter decided to try to be homosexual and play out the male role to try to be part of the family. She ends up going and becoming the doctor to try to be part of the family no matter what. The mother would reject. It her, rejected her, reject her. She ends up going and even having an affair with the same man that her mother dated prior to getting married, and having a boy, a baby boy, with that person, to try to bring a male into the family, to be part of the family. She tried everything. Her mother told her, You don't exist. You're no longer in our family. Please leave us well. That night, she called a friend of mine, and she was suicidal.

As you go up, it becomes more abstract, and you understand situational ethics, until you finally understand universal laws. When universal laws are there, you realize that these are synthesis of opposites, and that's what the purpose of the dialectic was used from Zeno. It was there to teach people to honor both sides of life. So at first you're going to make avoid that, seek that. But as the Buddhist said very beautifully, the desire for that which is unobtainable and the desire to avoid that which is unavoidable as a source of human suffering. People are suffering, trying to get rid of half of their life. If you look and you did a drone viewing of you or me or any human being for three months at a time, and video recorded them 24 hours a day, you wouldn't see a hero without a villain. You wouldn't see a saint without a sinner. You wouldn't see a pods without a negative. You wouldn't see a like without a dislike. Nature has a balance of opposites, and wisdom is the embracing of the two sides of life, not the fantasy of one sidedness. Now I've been studying this 53 years, and I'm certain that there's two sides of life. You have two sides. If I video recorded you, 24 hours a day, even though you're probably never going to put me on your show.

First thing you find is something like threat. Then you might find violence, then you might find deceit. You break it down, there's 18 most common things that I've seen in cases, 18. Now, if I asked you, have you ever threaten somebody? If you're honest, you'll have said, Yes, you've probably threatened somebody in your life. If I said you ever tried to force somebody to do something they didn't want to do. If you're honest with yourself, you probably have done that. Maybe your kids when they wanted to play and you said, No, do your homework. If you go and and you take a look at where You've deceived somebody, well, You've deceived yourself in some cases, and probably other people. If you break into its little components and identify all the components, and don't take the big generalization and label you have done the same thing. So the first thing I do with people that have been just I go in and help them find out what are the components, where do they have done them in their life? That calms down some of the judgment on it in the first place. So instead of being a victim, they're now looking at it with a little bit more rationality. Then I go in there. Let's take each one. What was the gain and the benefit that came out of that moment? And I did that in front of 600 people for a lady that was stabbed 18 times and left on a street with a chain to a piece of cement to be run over by trucks in about an hour and a half, she was in a state of gratitude. She shifted her perspective. She actually closed her eyes and saw the individual that did it. She was freed from the anger and resentment. She lost 45 to 50 pounds of weight. She changed her hair. She was now able to date people again. She started her own radio show in Washington, DC. Her life changed because I asked questions that she never got asked because she was trapped, and that was evil, and I'm now trapped for the rest of my life in that thing I made her look at where she did everything that he had done in her own form, she in her moan, metaphorically, even stabbed people in the back that were close friends. Her perspective, she found out what was the upsides to it. It helped her get out of a relationship she didn't want to be in. It helped her get out of a city she didn't want to live in. There's a whole lot of things that came out of it that she was very blessed by. When she got through she actually closed her eyes, saw the individual that experienced this from she had tears arise. She said, thank you. And that's something that most people don't comprehend. And most people are real caught in their little moral trips, and they're basically victims of history their whole life, instead of looking at a possibility that there may be an alternative way of looking at life.",

Could be maybe, but we have to. We study the philology and the exegesis of that text, we find out that that text is written over many centuries. That's not written by an individual like to claim, that's got textual things that prove that. So if we go through there we go. Is that sacred? Is that a human syncretic development of philosophy through great thinkers? We know that Aristotle and Plato and and the Neoplatonic philosophers and even Philo we're all influencing other, from Heraclitus influencing Christianity. We know that Aristotle influenced Muslims.

And the lady that helps me with the show is very much involved in the Middle East issues, Israel and Palestine. So she asked if I can come in and mediate the conflict between Palestinian and Israeli leaders. So they bring them into this room. When I walked a room, you put a knife in the air, it was thick because there's three Palestinians and five Israelis sitting across the table from each other, arch enemies in a room together. So as I'm about to begin, literally, you could feel so thick on the room because of all the tension in the room, it could just hold a knife there. The Israeli Lady spoke up and she said, Dr Demartini, do you believe in absolute evil? And they said, No. She said, Well, I do. I said, Is that why you spent 14 years trying to negotiate some sort of mediation and got nowhere? And she said, nothing, and her translator and mediator was chuckling, because she got it. And I said, So what do you mean by absolute evil? She said, Well, absolute evil, what do you mean by that you make that statement? It sounds good. That's a label, a generalized label that the amygdala does when it sees something that threatens you. Okay, so the thing that I think is absolute evil is the rigidity of about opinion and unwillingness to to listen to reason. Okay, that's absolute evil in her mind, and basically unwilling to come to a compromise. So in other words, real rigid belief system, is that what you're saying? Yes, okay, and basically a defensive, argumentative belief system. Great, okay, you say that's absolutely okay. So let's, let's just go to a moment where and when you perceive yourself displaying or demonstrating that behavior. It says, I pride myself on not being there. I never do that. I'm I don't do that. And she gave all this BS about how she never does that. The person over here is just sitting there, going, what? And she says, I don't do that. And I said, Well, I certainly do. I sometimes am argumentative and rigid and stuff like that. And I started listing all the places in my life. I did because I went through the Oxford English Dictionary and I found out I had 4628 individual traits in my life. Not one of them are missing in me. Nothing's missing it at the level of the Soul. Nothing's missing in you. At the level of the senses, things appear to be missing in you. The thing that appear to be missing you're all the things you're too proud or too humble to admit you don't you see in others you don't want to face in yourself, which is your disowned part, which is your emptiness. So I said, I certainly have those, those demanding and argumentative and rigid states at times. And I started listing all my examples. And when I gave it to I did it because I made her broaden her perspective of the form she might be doing it in. And she started, oh, I do have it here and here and here. And we found, I believe, 39 examples of where she had done what he had done. And as she did, her rigidity started calming down and realized, I'm judging him for parts of me. She got it. I made her keep going and made her accountable, instead of just blaming him and making him wrong and her being right, just where was her behavior? She saw it when she was doing it with her kids. She did it with her husband that's now estranged. She did it with people at work. She started seeing it, and we went all the way back into childhood, where she'd done it to her sister, and she just and she goes, hmm. I said, Can you see that you have injected some moral ideal about how you're supposed to be, and that person's not matching it, and you're not even matching it. You're not liking it about you not matching it, so you're projecting it onto him. And she goes, Can you own it now? And she got tear in her eye when she hit the point where it was equal. She goes, Okay, I can see that. Okay. Now. Now go to a moment where and when you perceive him that way, and rigid and not willing to see your side or your opinion, which you call reason, but it's not reasonable. It's just an opinion. So let's go and find out. When he did it. Go to that moment, great. In that moment, how did it benefit you? It didn't. I said, How'd it benefit you? Look, how did it help you, intellectually? How did well, I went back to school. Know why? Because I thought that was something unjust, and so I wanted to educate myself. And what do I can what I can do about it? I said, so you are not in you're not you did not finish your school and you went back to school. Is that a benefit that came out of his behavior, or your interpretation of his behavior? Yes. And did you get your degree? I finished my degree, I said, and is that something that you have gained some value out of? Yes, and what was that degree in social political science? I said, so you end up going into social political science because of that behavior. Yes. And have, I believe you have books out now, yes. And I believe you have millions of followers. Yes. Is that all a result of that whole process? Yes, did you ever thank him or give him a percentage of the royalties for what he initiated in you? And she goes, No, I said, but you can see a direct correlation between that stimulus and that response. Yes. And did that? Was that something you you're grateful for you because now you have children, and you're grateful that you were able to share all that knowledge with your children. With your children. Yes, but you didn't ever thank this guy that was so rigid and everything else that's been your arch enemy. Can you see your arch enemy is what drove you and motivated you to try to stand up and find out the opposite side, she goes, Yes, I said. And have you met Prime Ministers and and presidents and leaders of the world and been spoken to UN and everything else. She goes, yes. I said, would you have ever done that if you hadn't met that guy, or heard about that guy or had any interaction with him? I can't say for sure, but probably not. I was a mother at the time and just minding my own business. I said, so that terrible thing out there has blessed your life? She goes, yes. I said, Are you committed to having a resolution of this? Are you committed to being a leader and having a bunch of followers believe your system and have him be as your opponent so you have business in your political positioning? And she stopped and looked, and the mediator looked at her and kind of gave her a response, because if you're really committed to resolving this, we can resolve this today. If you're just committed to being right and making them wrong and just keeping this going and getting followers and getting good book sales and getting anything else, what's your real intention? I'm not going to judge it. It's yours. I'm just making you look at it. What's your real intention here? Because this thing is easily mediated, and this thing can be resolved. But if you're just going to go on and be right and be in your proud little moral construct, then then you're not going to get anywhere. So she humbled herself on the spot. She said, You just woke me up to something that I was unaware of. And I said, Okay, great. So what's your real commitment? She said, I really do want to mediate this. She cried. I said, So what's another benefit that came out of it? How did it help you and your family? She said, I'm a leader. I'm a strong family person. I got a husband that's taking helping me with the kids, and we have an amazing thing. And I said, What? How did it help you socially? She said, Well, that's self evident. How to help you economically? That's self evident because of what's happened. I said, Do you upgraded your entire life because of that absolute evil person over there? Now the guy is sitting across the table, not knowing that she's referring to him. When she finally saw the blessings in it, she broke down in tears and had to go and clean up her makeup. She walked out. Said, I need to do my makeup and relieve my bladder, because you've had me captive for a few hours here. When she went to the bathroom, he came up to me and says, I swear to God that I could feel that she was talking about me. I said she was says, listening to this whole dialog has made me dissolve some of my anger towards her, because I'm now going through the same process as she's doing this process I'm going through there. I said, I'm not even through. I said, there's another side, because anytime you take a position, you create an opposite position, she said. But he said, I'm not angry at her as much as I was, and I don't think she's angry at me as much now. I said, No, they're not. We can dialog now. We can start a conversation now, because if you're in a debate, you're not going to get anywhere. You're going to be right, and they're going to be right. You walk away and there's nothing's happened, but a dialectic can help you get to her. You're discovering her side, she's discovering your side, and the mode is behind it. Then he told me a great story. When she came back in, I made him say it to her. She said, he said, I don't know if you know this, to the lady, but I'm Israeli. She said, You are. She says, Yes, I was in the tank division as an Israeli, and I was ordered by my superior to completely smash an entire house and family, and I killed a bunch of kids and family, and I just couldn't deal with it. And I got out of the tank, and I walked away, and I defected, and I went on the other side. I said, I said, Okay. So now you're judging yourself. You're trying to make up for it and make some sort of amends, because you're now judging yourself for it, but you sure that that's not the perfection to help you transform your life and have a leadership to make a difference in saving more lives. He says, Well, I have saved 1000s and 1000s of lives without a doubt. I said, so maybe those lives are not taken in vain. Maybe there's a blessing there that we haven't seen yet. And he cried. He said, I never thought of it that way. I said, events have a purpose. If we extract out of it the pairs of opposites and find the meaning of it, they don't have a purpose. If we stuck in a label, we just go that that's wrong and right. You miss out on the meaning between the two. And we have these artificial meanings. We project onto things instead of the deeper. Aristotle and golden mean, the logo meaning the extracting meaning out of the whole thing, as he did in the concentration camps, which is why he survived, because he didn't see it as all evil and it's the end of the world. And he didn't hold on to fantasies about how it was supposed to be and torture himself by the comparison, he found meaning in that moment. And anytime you find meaning in that moment and find the blessing in that moment, you're you're transforming what's happening in that moment. And that's that's your agency at its fullest. So we got through. Not only did they have conversation, they hugged. 14 years of battle resolved. The lady came up to me, was a mediator, and she said, I've been with her for 14 years, mediating in these conflicts and meet and translating. Never see anything like this. Nobody had the balls to tell her that and ask her those questions and put her on the spot. They're afraid. It's politically correct. It's morally trapped, and we're just sitting here spinning our wheels. We haven't gone anywhere. You actually got actually got these two people on the thing. So I finished that. I came back three and a half months later to speak in Johannesburg again. She is involved in this big radio show in Johannesburg when she's there for the Israelis. And it's guarded security system I go into there, and she goes on there, and she told the entire story live on the air to a couple million people, and humbled herself and got off the high horse and said, I'm willing to lose my following for the sake of mediation. Now I'm not going to just agree with a group of people that are angry and be a leader of that people being angry. I'm actually realizing that that was a human being that I had in that room, and I had a misinterpretation of that person because of my moral trappings, and I now realize that he had another side, and he was not this evil person and absolute evil that I walked in with. So I do that every day my life's about resolving these delusions. So that's why I'm pretty strong about it, and it may not be, maybe offensive to the people listening here, but I'm not really concerned about that. That's not my focus to try to please everybody. My focus is to educate people on on ways they can transcend the boxes that they're in, which is their own. That's their limiting beliefs. They're subordinating to outer authorities. They're subordinating to moral hypocrisies, and they're trapping themselves in what they don't even know is going on, and they're capable of doing something magnificent, if they honor both sides of themselves. But what's magnificent? The magnificence of the awareness of the whole picture is part of the loving act.",

It's an abstraction. We really don't know what energy and matter is it's a mystery. Nobody knows what energy is not a scientist on this planet does. They just know how to use it. So we go through and we teach people the illusion into the ready for truth. And the ready for Truth is the abstraction of not knowing. So we really don't know what's good and evil.

Well, if it's not, I get to work with the family. But what about the child? I don't know. Can you prove that his death is is absolute evil? I don't know. If it opens up a doorway of opportunity for the family, it may be a gift. I've seen that actually happen. I saw I'll give a real case Dallas, Texas, a family calls and said, we just had my son get run over, and he's dead, and we're distraught. Can we come see you? And I said, I'm coming to Dallas tomorrow. We'll meet after my speech. We'll meet. Mother stays out in the car, in the garage. She can't she's too emotional. The son and the father come in there, and we asked him a question, what is the upside to this situation that your son just got killed? And they said, Well, how can it be an upside? Well, if you choose only to see the downside, there'll never be an upside. You'll you'll have to discover it over time, but you could discover it now. What's the upside? And they stopped and they reflected, and he said, without a doubt, it's brought our family absolutely like I've never seen it this close in the last since this happened. Great. What else my son was sitting on the fence in his career about what he wanted to do, and we've made a decision that we're going to open up a sausage manufacturing company in the name of my son and our family is this is a family business we're going to do as a result of this event, great. And we're going to honor my son as this because this was his dream. We're going to carry it out great. What's another benefit there? My wife has been overly protective of the sun, and now she realizes that this, this trauma, has happened like that. She realizes that she's been set free because she's been tortured and sleepless nights dealing with the sun. What's another benefit? Finally, we got enough benefits where they're calm, they're not distraught for a moment. Right at that moment, the mother comes out of the garage, and she comes in, and she comes and hugs the husband, and she says, it's all going to work out. Now, I said, What did? What did? Realization. I just saw what we're going to do, and I feel that that's the gift in the long run for everyone involved. And so she saw it from a different perspective. And so I look at it, I go, Yes, he was killed. Am I going to say that that's evil? Nope. Am I going to say that that's a perception of loss in the family? Okay, temporarily, but in the same moment, there's a unification and blessings that come out of that, to not focus on that and just make it absolutely bad or wrong or whatever. To me, it's very, very shallow. It's much wiser to go and find out how the other side of the equation is and balance the equation and get reasoned again. Get out of the emotional labels and generalizations and distortions and highly emotive states which causes illness, and get back into reason. Ralph Waldo Emerson said it very greatly in one of his quotes, he says, We cry foolishly with people that are in traumas like that, instead of hitting them with rough electric shocks and getting in touch with reason. Again, I really believe that that regulate because that family built that manufactured company. That picture of her son is. Is on that front of that company, his dream is sitting there, manifested in that company as a family, unified the family. Is it evil? I don't know. I don't know those answers. You may, you may think you know. You may read a book and tells you it is. It's an accident. It's not an accident, unless you choose to make an accident.

One is violated in morality is stronger because you think you have an intention on it. But if we go back to causality, why would somebody do that? What's the what's their experiences that led to that is that the cause of why that happened is the cause of those people, it's murky. I don't want to go there. I'd rather just go in there and find out, okay, it happened. Now let's, let's transform it into something useful now, because otherwise we're going to be trapped and we're going to just label it. We're going to blame. I'm not seeing blame or credit with the devil or Jesus give people their empowerment. I do believe that using the wisdom of the great teachings of Christianity and some of the things that were taught in there, not all of them, because there's texts that have been deleted, I believe that some of that is use, but I don't believe that that's you don't want to disempower yourself by thinking somebody out there is going to take care of your problems, and somebody over there is causing your problems, if you go into credit and blame and not take on accountability and see the order of life. I think you're missing out, and you're staying in your amygdala and not getting your executive function, not using a reason.",

Any area of your life you don't master, you're going to be over mastered, overpowered. You don't empower yourself intellectually, be told what to think. Don't empower yourself mentally or in business, you'll be told what to do if you don't empower yourself financial, be told what you're worth. Don't empower yourself in relationship, you'll be honey do crap around the house. Don't empower yourself socially, you'll be taught misinformation, dogma. You don't empower civility.
